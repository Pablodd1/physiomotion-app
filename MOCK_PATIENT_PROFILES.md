### **ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1. HOME SAFETY EVALUATION & MODIFICATIONS**

**Identified Hazards:**
- Area rugs (caused Fall #2) → REMOVE or secure with double-sided tape
- Poor bathroom lighting (contributed to Fall #1) → Install nightlight, increase wattage
- Low toilet seat → Install raised toilet seat (add 4 inches)
- Bathtub without shower chair → Already has chair (good!)
- No grab bars in strategic locations → Add near bed, in hallway

**Recommended Modifications:**
- Remove all area rugs or secure edges
- Increase lighting throughout apartment (especially bathroom, hallways)
- Install grab bars near toilet, in shower, beside bed
- Organize apartment to minimize reaching/bending
- Keep frequently used items at waist height
- Ensure phone/medical alert pendant always accessible
- Consider motion-sensor nightlights for nighttime bathroom trips
- Remove clutter from walkways
- Secure electrical cords
- Non-slip mat in bathtub (if not already present)

**2. ASSISTIVE DEVICE RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Current:** Single-point cane (uses inconsistently)

**Recommendations:**
- Continue cane use (especially outdoors and stairs)
- Ensure cane is proper height (wrist level when standing upright, elbow ~30° flexion)
- Consider quad cane for outdoor use (increased stability)
- **DO NOT recommend walker at this time** (patient resistance, stigma) - revisit if no progress in 8 weeks
- Ensure cane has good rubber tip (replace if worn)

**3. MEDICATION REVIEW**

**Concern:** 11 medications, several with fall-risk potential

**Recommendations:**
- Refer back to PCP for medication review
- Consider:
  - Timing of medications (avoid clustering medications that cause dizziness)
  - Gabapentin: Taken at night (good), but may cause morning grogginess
  - Blood pressure medications: Check for orthostatic hypotension
  - Meloxicam: Daily NSAID use - discuss alternatives (topical NSAIDs, acetaminophen)
- Ensure patient takes medications as prescribed (no missed doses)
- Use pill organizer (already doing - good!)

**4. VISION & HEARING CHECKS**

**Recommendations:**
- Refer to ophthalmologist for eye exam (last cataract surgery 2018, needs update)
- Check glasses prescription (may need bifocal adjustment for fall prevention)
- Hearing test (impaired hearing can affect balance)

**5. FOOTWEAR ASSESSMENT**

**Current:** Wears slip-on shoes (easy on/off but may lack support)

**Recommendations:**
- Proper athletic shoes with:
  - Good arch support
  - Non-slip soles
  - Secure closure (laces or Velcro, not slip-on)
  - Low heel height
- Avoid:
  - Backless slippers
  - High heels
  - Worn-out soles
  - Shoes that are too loose

**6. NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS**

**Concerns:** Diabetes, osteoporosis, sarcopenia

**Recommendations:**
- Adequate protein intake (1.0-1.2 g/kg/day = 68-82g protein)
  - Current weight: 68 kg
  - Ensures muscle maintenance/growth
- Vitamin D supplementation (already taking - good!)
- Calcium intake (dietary + supplement)
- Ensure adequate hydration (dehydration affects balance)
- Refer to dietitian if needed

**7. FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION**

**Topics to Cover:**
- Recognize fall risk factors
- Safe movement strategies (e.g., sit at edge of bed before standing)
- What to do if you fall (practiced floor-to-stand)
- Importance of reporting falls/near-falls
- Medication side effects to watch for
- When to use assistive device
- Home safety awareness

**8. SOCIAL SUPPORT & MONITORING**

**Recommendations:**
- Continue medical alert pendant (excellent!)
- Daily check-in with son or daughter (phone call or text)
- Encourage participation in senior center activities
  - Social interaction reduces depression/isolation
  - Physical activities (tai chi, seated yoga classes)
  - Builds community support network
- Consider emergency response plan with neighbors
- Ensure family members aware of fall risk and prevention strategies

**9. PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT**

**Concern:** Fear of falling, anxiety about independence

**Recommendations:**
- Address fear openly (normalize concerns)
- Celebrate small victories (build confidence)
- Set realistic, achievable goals
- Consider support group for fall survivors (if available)
- May benefit from counseling if anxiety becomes overwhelming

- Lives in supportive senior community
- Good cognitive function (mild impairment but able to learn)
- Medically stable (diabetes and hypertension controlled)
- Already has medical alert system
- Financially able to afford modifications/equipment

**Barriers to Success:**
- Multiple comorbidities (osteoarthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis)
- Significant baseline weakness and balance impairment
- Chronic pain limits exercise tolerance
- Fear of falling (may resist challenging exercises)
- Lives alone (compliance monitoring challenging)
- Medicare limitations (may not cover all therapy visits)

**Risk Factors for Falls (Ongoing):**
- High fall risk score (STEADI 12/12)
- Previous falls (2 in past month)
- Multiple medications
- Sensory deficits (peripheral neuropathy)
- Environmental hazards (partially addressed)

**Recommendations:**
1. Physical therapy 3x/week for 12 weeks (36 visits)
   - May need to extend based on progress
2. Home exercise program daily (caregiver supervision initially)
3. Home safety evaluation (OT consult or PT home visit)
4. Refer to PCP for medication review
5. Vision and hearing assessments
6. Consider aquatic therapy (if available and covered by insurance)
   - Buoyancy reduces joint stress
   - Excellent for strengthening with low pain
7. Re-evaluation at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and discharge
8. Fall diary (track near-falls, falls, circumstances)
9. Pain management strategies (ice/heat, topical analgesics)
10. Consider tai chi or chair yoga class at senior center (maintenance program after PT discharge)

**Cautions:**
- Monitor blood pressure before/after exercise (orthostatic hypotension risk)
- Watch for signs of overexertion (increased pain, fatigue, dizziness)
- Ensure safety at all times (therapist/caregiver supervision initially)
