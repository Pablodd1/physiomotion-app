## 🏥 Architecture

### Frontend (Three.js + TensorFlow.js)
```
Video Input → MediaPipe Pose → Joint Tracking → 3D Rendering
                                     ↓
                             Gemini AI Analysis
                                     ↓
                         Medical Report Generation
```

### Backend (Hono + Cloudflare)
```
Authentication → Patient DB → Assessments → Reports
      ↓              ↓             ↓           ↓
